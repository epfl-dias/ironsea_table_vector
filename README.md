# Iron Sea - Vector Table

## Introduction

This implements the `Table`, `Store`, `Load` trait, as a simple `Vec` wrapper, enabling it to be stored and passed to indices.

## Iron Sea: Database Toolkit

**Iron Sea** provides a set of database engine bricks, which can be combined and applied on arbitrary data structures.

Unlike a traditional database, it does not assume a specific physical structure for the tables nor the records, but relies on the developper to provide a set of extractor functions which are used by the specific indices provided.

This enables the index implementations to be agnostic from the underlying data structure, and re-used.

## Requirements
